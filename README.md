# Atmanaut

A hugo-powered static site using the chakra theme, ready to link up with a
Forestry.io CMS, and auto-deployable on now.sh.

## TODO
- [ ] flesh out tagging system for asidebar and posts
- [ ] consider annotation lane for links and sidenotes (a la footnotes)
- [ ] learn how to direct link to other posts
- [x] style summaries: timestamps, titles, etc.
- [x] add routes to `now.json` to enable Github master push deploy
  - move `now.json` back to root
  - change npm scripts to work with new build config
- [x] add logo
