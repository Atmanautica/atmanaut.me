> I want you to believe that the universe is a vast, random, uncaring place, in which our species our world has absolutely no significance. And I want you to believe that the only response is to make our own beauty and meaning, and to share it while we can. I want you to believe … that you are a way for the universe to be in awe of itself.

Which begs the question: why would Katie Mack, a theoretical astrophysicist, want us to believe these notions?

The probable answer is simple: she likely stakes her identity on these beliefs. Our identities, our egos, are woven of fictions like these. To persist they must compel us to project their component fictions into the world, to maintain correspondence. As within, so without.
