# What is this all about?

And what the devil/good heavens is an **atmanaut**?

Well, that depends on what an atman is, doesn't it, and if you ask your friendly neighborhood Buddhist, you might get a puzzling answer. "Atman? Oh, that's nothing. It seems like it's there, but it's not. It's just an illusion."

Who moves my hands? Who is asking all these questions? Who can tell the truth from a lie? Who loves you, baby?

As you can see, I'm more Q than A. I mean, I'll give you answers, but don't expect me to believe them. Am I qualified for this line of work? Does the pope shit in a funny hat?
