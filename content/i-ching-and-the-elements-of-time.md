This week was riddled with synchronicity. After some initial resistance which I now can't explain, I have finally opened my mind to Terence McKenna. He was and is a whirring dynamo of synchronicity and lateral induction. I wasn't ready, but I doubt anyone is ever truly ready to encounter Terence McKenna. Gratitude to those who record and publish the wanderings of his scrying mind that are available on YouTube and otherwise. The recordings of McKenna, Alan Watts, and Joseph Campbell lie waiting in a seemingly bottomless well of wisdom, insight, and wonderment freely available to all of us. It wasn't always this way. We used to have to learn Sanskrit and Mandarin, spend a decade in the Amazon, and decipher cuneiform and hieroglyphics to gain an understanding of such magnitude and profundity. It's no wonder few did.

Anyway, one of the innumerable of avenues of wonder and inquiry I have skipped down briefly with Terence has been the I Ching. As one of the oldest written works, if not the oldest, the I Ching holds an ancient message which the western world has only just begun to decipher. The English translations vary greatly in approach, tone, and execution, some taking a succinct Taoist slant, others emphasizing Confucian politics, or even drawing on the Latin interpretations of the Jesuits. Indeed as texts have bobbed about in the waves of time, they have undergone both subtle and drastic transformations and recapitulations.

Within moments of deciding to research the I Ching, I have dug myself underground. Let's take this slowly, start with the familiar, and use the Buddy System. [The Bard](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2D0E32265BBFA843) is everyone's buddy when it comes to traipsing through the numinous and deciphering the arcane. His interest in the I Ching no doubt sprouted during his early study of Carl Jung, whose own interest in the I Ching and its 64 hexagrams had a profound impact on the system of 64 archetypes he would develop through his life. Here lies a rich vein: why did Jung mirror the hexagrams in his archetypes?

McKenna points out another: could the permutations of the I Ching represent a kind of periodic table of situations? He posits that while we in the West were decoding the mysteries of matter and energy, culminating in two World Wars, and ushering in the Nuclear Age, the Chinese were devising a taxonomy of happenings, or perhaps prototyping time itself in this Book of Changes.

I for one will be looking for yarrow stalks as I jog the creek amidst the rising spring.
