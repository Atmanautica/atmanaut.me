It is a landmark event in anyone's life: the sudden comprehension that there are **others**. For most of us, this lightning bolt strikes before we have developed the grammar or syntax we would need to construct a memory of such a concept. Consequently we don't remember it. But it strikes none the less and we bear the scar throughout our lives. The bolt misses some—perhaps they dodge it—who are no doubt baffled by the rest of us who once were of one mind and now perceive many, who call ourselves members of society, humanity, or civilization.

Developmental psychologists refer to this phenomenal discovery of others as the [theory of mind](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Theory_of_mind "Theory of Mind on Wikipedia"), which occurs to me, a layman, to be a misnomer. At the very least we are discussing a theory of **_minds_**. But is it a theory at all? Most human beings develop a "theory of mind" at eighteen months to three years old. But can a three-year-old theorize? This is uncertain, and would be unproductive to debate for our intents and purposes. We can agree, however, that a three-year-old can agree, or disagree. A litmus test for agreeability?

### "Do you want some broccoli?"

Agreements—[in the Don Miguel Ruiz sense of the word](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6596.The_Four_Agreements "Ruiz' Four Agreements on GoodReads")—form the foundation of our relationship with existence. They define the Self and shape our default perception of reality. Suffice it to say, we stand to benefit from making a careful inventory of the agreements that define us.

When we acquiesce to the Agreement of Otherhood, few if any of us are able to read the terms of the contract we are signing. In fairness, this is not the only fundamental agreement we make unawares. Similar agreements foisted upon us as babes sow the seeds of bigotry, misanthropy, and mortality and the fear, guilt, shame, sadism, and self-loathing they inspire. Though it may manifest in a wide array of pathologies, we can trace each of them back to the same unconscious, but deluded original agreement: Otherhood. From the fiction of Otherhood we imagine that each individual awareness is separate and independent. And as these raw membranes of consciousness subdivided rub and chafe each other, the calluses of ego thicken and harden, sealing the pathogen in each cell of awareness, each drop of the ocean.

But do not despair. This is only one way to play the game. It is probably not a winning strategy. But it is also not clear whether this is a game to be won or lost. What we do know is that without Otherhood, no one would compete. Why roll the dice if **you _are_ your opponents**?

## Culling the Herd

It has only been a year since I became conscious of the agreements that define me. At first my inner eye refused to focus on them, like I was trying to watch a tear form, which is not quite as tricky as an eye trying to see itself. Eventually I managed to float the glowing orb of awareness into that shadowy nook of gullibility. The agreements I found may not shock you. They may just ring a bell. Here's a sample (and how they fared in the light of consciousness).

1. May the best one win. (False, there's nothing to win.)
2. The truth is out there. (False, it's in here.)
3. All life is sacred. (False, life is born to die. Mind is sacred.)
4. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not to their own facts. (False, no authority exists to grant such entitlement.)
5. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all \[humans\] are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." (False, we weren't created. We grew. And no rights grew with us.)
6. You Only Live Once (Unknown, but you never stop being.)
7. Self-improvement is masturbation. (False, the self is not just me.)
8. This too shall pass. (True, all is impermanent • अनिच्चा • anicca)
9. Love is the answer. (True. Love is the new 42.)

Platitudes and aphorisms mostly. Words to live by? Or words to leave (a room) by? You be the judge. I kept the last two and binned the rest. And I am the author of my truth, but no one's besides. Perhaps that is the purpose of the illusion of Otherhood, to give each drop of consciousness the thrill of divining the Truth from its precious, one-of-a-kind perspective, and then the thrill of trying to explain it. Pretty fun game, eh? How'm I doing?

## Enter the Monorepo

Now, I haven't worked for an organization that stores its work product in a monorepo, at least not the implementations I've read about at Google, Facebook, and the like. But I have a certain suspicion that they are on the right track. Not for tactical or technical reasons, and in the short term. But in the long run, once we all have awoken from this deluded dream of Otherhood, the Monorepo will be the only sensical mode of version control.

I must apologize if I am not making sense. I'm skipping ahead quite a bit.

At the current moment in 2019, all over the world individual minds are claiming distinct identities and adopting more reliable methods of establishing their relative value to each other. Power, control, wealth are decentralizing, storage, services, functions are becoming distributed. RESTful APIs and reactive, functional programming enable serverless data streams to flow ocean currents, carrying data plankton along for the whales to follow. Each granule is honed toward its ideal in the distributed, decentralized ecosystem, they tumble like semi-precious stones, knocking each others' sharp edges off, polishing with every issue, a unit test at a time. Eventually the granules will pulverize each other until only magic dust remains, so fine and dense that the heat of its affinity begins to fuse the powdery core.

And so the one true Monorepo takes hold. This is a ways off of course. But it's never too early to prepare for immortality.
