It's a landmark event in anyone's life: the sudden comprehension that there are others. For most of us, this lightning bolt strikes before we have developed the grammar or syntax we would need to construct a memory of such a concept. It strikes none the less and we bear the scar throughout our lives. The bolt misses some—or perhaps they dodge it—who no doubt find society baffling.

Developmental psychologists refer to this phenomenon as [theory of mind](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Theory_of_mind "Theory of Mind on Wikipedia").
