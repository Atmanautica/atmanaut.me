# On Love, Day One

It's February again, already.

> Cupid, draw back your bow-ooh-whoaâ€¦

You know that thing where you find out your ex is seeing somebody new, somebody named Jamie, and suddenly there are "Jamies" all over the place. Practically all your Google Search results contain "Jamie"... Wait a sec, did Facebook get hacked? More like Jamiebook... Welp, gonna need another bottle of Jamieson. Has it always been spelled like that? ... No way, nice license plate `JMEROX`! ... Even the evening news is in on it. "Grimshaw County police investigate a spree of hit-and-runs this afternoon. Tune in at 10 to find out how it's all Jamie's fault."

Psychologists call this phenomenon ~~a psychotic jealous narcissism vortex~~ confirmation bias.
