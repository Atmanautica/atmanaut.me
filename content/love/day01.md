# On Love, Day One

It's February again, already.

> Cupid, draw back your bow-ooh-whoaâ€¦

You know that thing where you find out your ex is seeing somebody new, somebody named Jamie, and suddenly there are "Jamies" all over the place. Practically all your Google Search results contain "Jamie"... Wait a sec, did Facebook get hacked? More like Jamiebook... Welp, gonna need another bottle of Jamieson. Has it always been spelled like that? ... No way, nice license plate `JMEROX`! ... Even the evening news is in on it. "Grimshaw County police investigate a spree of hit-and-runs this afternoon. Tune in at 10 to find out how it's all Jamie's fault."

Psychologists call this phenomenon *priming*. It's akin to a fitness technique called "greasing the groove". As the theory goes and practice validates, when learning a new movement that requires strength and coordination, e.g. a pull-up, the optimal strategy is to playfully, patiently, sporadically complete the movement, never to exhaustion, never to failure, but always correctly. Our bodies are very capable of growing to accommodate our intent, if we treat them (ourselves) with love. But don't take my word for it. There are oodles of [testimonials from the groove greasers](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/9zrpga/grease_the_groove_is_truly_a_miracle/) out there.

Last March I heard Tom Campbell utter four little words in an interview on YouTube, and suddenly everything made sense. As though a switch flipped and the lights came on, illuminating everything. Our purpose became clear, and my tribulations vaporized. I haven't been the same since. https://youtu.be/U5_z4C6LNKw?t=702

I've spent every waking moment since then trying to figure out what to do with this new understanding, how to communicate it, who to share it with. That's why we're both here right now.

First I read Tom's book, which was a doozy. And while I don't agree wholly with his Big Theory of Everything, he's right about **one thing** (even if he's wrong about everything else). Love is the answer. ``

It was reading Alan Watts' *The Way of Zen* that cracked the nut.
