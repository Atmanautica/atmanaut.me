# I can't help myself.

I just have so many questions.

- Who are we?
- How did we get here?
- Why are we here?
- Who wants to know?
- Is this a game?
- How do we win?
- Can we win?
- What is there to fear?
- Who wants pizza?
- Is there anybody out there?
- Does the Earth know we're here?
- Does she have feelings?
- Do electrons make choices?
- Is time real?
- Did I really retire?
- Is that cat alive?
- Why is the universe expanding faster?
- Do the laws of nature change?
- How did pi, *e*, phi, G, and the rest of the magic numbers arise?
- Is everything made of maths? Quantum fields? Possibility? Information? Mind?
- What tastes worse with bacon?
- What do whales and birds sing about?
- Can an AI learn what dogs and cats are saying?
- Will I find true love?
- Will I ever get laid again?
- Do I have cancer?
- Can we cure death?
- Why can't I lift myself off the ground?
- Is this normal? Am I okay?
- Whose line is it, anyway?
