# Why?

[Somewhat apocryphally](https://books.google.com/books?id=L8RVOCHtWXQC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=%22if+you+can%27t+find+it+anywhere+else%22+%22look+in+this%22&source=bl&ots=LY5Y7SU_Aj&sig=ACfU3U2NsTh51nideVAVsI-kXhqWLbHarA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjmjMHood3gAhXH7oMKHRhbB9gQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22if%20you%20can't%20find%20it%20anywhere%20else%22%20%22look%20in%20this%22&f=false), Abe Lincoln tamed the disorder of his Springfield law office with a pile of papers labeled "If you can't find it anywhere else, look here." Trying to find a common thread in the research that increasingly consumes me has left me wanting just such an envelope. But, hey, it's 2019, why not make it a website?

## This is an atlas for those who ask "Why‽"

Do you remember your first question? I'll venture a guess that it was wordless, possibly even non-conceptual, which is puzzling. What question can one ask without words or concepts?

[The etymology of the word 'why'](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*kwo-#etymonline_v_52739) traces back to what seems like a general state of Proto-Indo-European confusion where who, what, why, when, where, whom, how much, comme, query, whither, which, whence, and [cheese](https://www.etymonline.com/word/cheese?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_45485) all come from the `*kwo-` tree. In a time before language, there may have been only one question. .

### I don't think we need a word to ask "Why‽"

Some philosophers hold that thought springs from language, or even that mind is language. These tend to be a subset of those who hold humans apart from (and superior to) the rest of nature on the grounds of one factor or ability. [Many](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10986236-the-recursive-mind) [books](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20977059-human-purpose-and-transhuman-potential) [have](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14568718-the-marvelous-learning-animal) been written on this subject. We devote [whole departments](https://iho.asu.edu/) of higher education to answering this arguably futile question. *Homines sapientes* we  Philosophers devote themselves to expressing thoughts as precisely as possible. It is their charge. Those who think differently but do not articulate themselves as clearly struggle to contest them.

Can we think without language? Or is that merely feeling? When I think of an apple, I can visualize it, or imagine biting into it. I can remove the word 'apple' and still see it and taste it, so to speak.

I will propose a few exercises in futility and then get to the point.

Take a quiet moment to breath and stop. Then try one these…
1. Feel without thinking.
2. Think without words.
3.
