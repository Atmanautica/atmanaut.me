## Perspectives

from [a critique of Doughnut Economics as too Western](https://views-voices.oxfam.org.uk/2012/02/is-doughnut-economics-too-western/ "Is doughnut economics too Western? Critique from Latin American environmentalist, Eduardo Gudynas")

> But in my view, a discussion about sustainability requires the idea of development to be questioned, especially the Western conception of development. There are undoubtedly many ways of understanding development, and we have seen capitalist programmes with varying emphasis (neoliberal, Keynesian, neo-Keynesian, etc.), as well as socialist programmes (e.g. the Soviet model and all its variants), and even complex hybrids (like that of China). These tendencies have significant differences in terms of the role of state, the concept of property, and ways of redistributing wealth. The ‘right to development’ was also spoken about, which would greatly complicate the doughnut. But what is striking is that **they all share a set of basic ideas, all of them Western, such as the belief in progress, the appropriation of nature, and the dream of material comfort**. ‘Development’ involves common principles for organising society, production, and the relationship with the environment.

> The social and environmental crisis is so serious that it is now time to put aside minor adjustments and reforms, and instead address the root causes of resistance to the idea of development. We must adopt an approach whereby the term ‘sustainable development’ no longer requires the suffix ‘development’.

## Premises

When designing a model, we must first define its foundational assumptions. When evaluating a model, we must first expose and examine its premises.

## Questions

Can development coincide with sustainability and/or vice versa?

Can we pursue sustainable refinement without focusing on progress or development?
