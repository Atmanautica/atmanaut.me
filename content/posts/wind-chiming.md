Late at night, lying awake breathing  
to the steady bing bong of the breeze  
poofing on the paper paddle  
dangling from what hangs within  
banging against verdigris bellpipes.

Inhaling easy up to four, then  
blowing out slower down to eight  
while the wind keeps unseen time  
in a beatless meter on a clock of ether.

Echoes fade as I fall  
home feeling cradled  
netted in gossamer guylines all  
slung in a feathery web:  
air's elastic bones.

Footless, fancifully I dance  
with no-body: a geist in the sky.  
I sweep the waves to sea-land-sea.  
I churn the flames from tree to tree,  
a chthonic gust. Chaos must.

Still, lying by the chimes,  
the breather draws me in  
pulls me deep, lets me swim  
in blood river. Uses me up,  
spits me out, and sets me free.

I crave your lungs.  
My loins whisper  
to join your flesh to our will,  
so I poof on the paper paddle  
to seduce you to inspire.  
Then I ride into your eyes  
cracking open at sunrise,  
into ears hearing me chiming.
