Bold fellow that he was, Immanuel Kant summed up all of philosophy in just three questions:

* **What can I know?**
* **What should I do?**
* **What may I hope?**

We'll come back to these. But while we're entertaining reductions, let's bend an ear to Albert Camus too. "[There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.](http://www2.hawaii.edu/\~freeman/courses/phil360/16.%20Myth%20of%20Sisyphus.pdf "An Absurd Reasoning by Albert Camus")" Perhaps its solution lies in blissful, defiant absurdity. "One must imagine Sisyphus happy" If you haven't yet, I implore you to take a moment to read "The Myth of Sisyphus". [This little gem](http://dbanach.com/sisyphus.htm "The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus") altered my path suddenly and profoundly, like a tornado that wipes out the farm and leaves farmer and family —"farmily"?—intact and oddly liberated. Some works of art resonate with such an intricate chaotic harmony, like a fateful nugget of pietersite, that they can blow the doors off my chakras before I even feel a breeze.

What was the first question you asked? Mine was "Why?" I never got an answer; I guess I'm still asking. Did you get an answer?

I remember being small, laying awake at night, wondering "Who am I? How did I get here? Why am I here? Does anyone know?" Is this why many parents involve their children in organized religions? When faced with questions one cannot answer, one can either shrug, admit ignorance, and lose the audience, or spin a yarn. A proper yarn, like the thread of Atropos, need never end if new fibers twine in as the old ones run out. The yarn can then be strung through a labyrinth of mandates, prohibitions, and taboos leading any Hansel or Gretel on a lifelong goose chase through a forest of well-disguised non-answers to the simple questions that plague (I presume) every child as they become self-conscious.

Rupert Spira advises us to ask, in times of quietude, "Am I aware?" This is perhaps the key to Prometheus' box.

* Who wants to know?
* Is this a game?
* How do we win?
* Can we win?
* What is there to fear?
* Who wants pizza?
* Is there anybody out there?
* Does the Earth know we're here?
* Does she have feelings?
* Do electrons make choices?
* Is time real?
* Did I really retire?
* Is that cat alive?
* Why is the universe expanding faster?
* Do the laws of nature change?
* How did pi, _e_, phi, G, and the rest of the magic numbers arise?
* Is everything made of maths? Quantum fields? Possibility? Information? Mind?
* What tastes worse with bacon?
* What do whales and birds sing about?
* Can an AI learn what dogs and cats are saying?
* Will I find true love?
* Will I ever get laid again?
* Do I have cancer?
* Can we cure death?
* Is this normal? Am I okay?
* Whose line is it, anyway?
