inhale\
a long, still morning\
pleasant dog breath\
a cookie-cutter-perfect spoon\
the occasional pause-button tiny death<!--more-->
smiling while pooping / a bidet\
the strength to lift, hold, carry\
finding a comfortable seat\
ƒÅnandasana

a garden that vomits vege\
a cookie-batter-covered spoon\
neighbors who meet your smize\
flip-flops that fit like gloves

a high hammock in the setting sun\
a brush-tip archival ink pen\
a span of spontaneous solitude

peeling off the scab\
rolling in dirt, diving into waves\
walking all day, eating by campfire\
conscious, artisanal blinking\
glassy-mountain-lake mind

cuddles before slumber\
playful dreams\
the cool side of the pillow

none of this, but this breath\
exhale\
repeat
