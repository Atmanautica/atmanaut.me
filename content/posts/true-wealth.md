# True Wealth

Inhale  
A long, still morning  
Pleasant dog breath  
A cookie-cutter-perfect spoon  
The occasional pause-button orgasm  
Smiling while pooping<!--more> / a bidet  
The strength to lift, hold, carry  
Comfortable seats — Ānandasana  
A garden that vomits vege  
A cookie-batter-covered spoon  
Neighbors who meet your smize  
Flip-flops that fit like gloves  
A high hammock in the setting sun  
A brush-tip archival ink pen  
A span of spontaneous solitude  
Peeling off the scab  
Rolling in dirt, diving into waves  
Walking all day, eating by campfire  
Slow conscious blinking  
Glassy-mountain-lake mind  
Cuddles before slumber  
Playful dreamy sleep  
The cool side of the pillow  
None of this, but this breath  
Exhale  
Repeat
