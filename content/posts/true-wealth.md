dreaming  
the cool side of the pillow

inhaling  
a long, still morning  
pleasant dog breath

feeling  
a cookie-cutter-perfect spoon nestling  
the occasional pause-button tiny death<!--more-->  
every cell of my body vibrating at once  
raw, unbridled rage/joy/misery/ecstasy  
connected

finding  
ƒÅnandasana  
a comfortable seat  
the strength to lift, hold, carry  
a bidet  
smiling while pooping

sharing  
a garden that vomits vege  
a table  
a cookie-batter-covered spoon  
neighbors who meet your size  
  
enjoying  
flip-flops that fit like gloves  
a brush-tip archival ink pen  
a high hammock in the setting sun  
a span of spontaneous solitude

daring to care  
peeling off the scab  
rolling in the dirt, diving into waves  
walking all day, eating by campfire  
conscious, artisanal blinking  
  
nothing  
glassy mountain lake mind  
exhaling  
repeating
