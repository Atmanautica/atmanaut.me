Some linkbait caught me today: **"[Neuroscience reveals 4 rituals that will make you happy](https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/neuroscience-4-rituals-happy)"**.

I'll save you the ten minutes of shameful scanning.
1. Gratitude
2. Mindfulness (of negativity)
3. Decisive action
4. Kind touch

As it turns out, Mr. Barker is summarizing some of his takeaways from a 2015 book by UCLA neuroscientist [Alex Korb, Ph.D.](https://alexkorbphd.com/), called *The Upward Spiral: Using Neuroscience to Reverse the Course of Depression, One Small Change at a Time*. Having not read Dr. Korb's work yet, I'll not be commenting on it. But this notion did spark an insight I hope we can develop.

Here in the Postmodern West, we're experiencing a crashing tidal wave of technostress and agoraloneliness. We have built a flabbergasting array of tools to prevent and assuage suffering and to connect each of us to just about anyone else. And yet, by any account, we are no happier. The ADAA estimates that 18.1% of adult Americans suffer from anxiety disorders (which includes depression).

Is this more or less than before? It's hard to say. We are a lot better at counting than we used to be, thanks to all these computers and algorithms crunching our Big Data. And we'll certainly be able to monitor trends in our aggregate well-being from now on, but knowing whether we are subjectively better off in the Age of Information than we were in the Industrial Age is impossible.

Objectively speaking, the quality of human life has improved drastically since we stopped with the global genocides in the 1940s. Infant mortality, disease, famine, drought, even minor discomfort are at all-time lows today, while per capita GDP, life expectancy, and disposable income are soaring. The numbers are in; we're better off. The quality of life on Earth more generally is another question entirely. Are the trees better off now? The birds? The fish? I'm hearing resounding negatories on all accounts.

Environmental disaster aside, why aren't we ecstatic? Quite simply, we can't be, not in aggregate.
