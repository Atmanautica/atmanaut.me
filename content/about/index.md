Sure it's a made-up word, just like all the rest of them.

When Siddhartha sat himself beneath the Buddha Tree, what did he intend to explore?

Who is aware of dreaming?

Who is watching these thoughts?

Who feels awe at sunset?

Who gets caught in a baby's gaze?

All of these can be called Atman.

Here we set sail into the soul we share.
