# Chakra Khan

The impetus for this site was balance.

For years now, I have diligently combed the word for answers to the tough questions, the hard problem.

I'm not convinced the answers are out there, but it has given me something to do with my *prana*.

But today, I'm feeling out of whack. Too much input, not enough output.
