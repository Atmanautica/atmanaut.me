# Chakra Khan

The impetus for this site was balance.

For years now, I have diligently combed the world for answers to the tough questions, the hard problem.

I'm not convinced the answers are out there, but it has given me something to do with my _prana_.

But today, I'm feeling out of whack. Too much input, not enough output.
