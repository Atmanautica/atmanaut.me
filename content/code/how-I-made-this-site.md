# How I Made This Site

Delightfully often, when I've combed the web for help designing, developing, and publishing sites, apps, I land on someone's "How I Made This" post on their custom blog. That or StackOverflow, a Github issue, or these days increasingly on [DEV](dev.to) (good on you!). So this one goes out to all the keyboard monkeys that paid it forward and lent me a hand without asking for anything in return.

It still feels like nothing short of a miracle to publish a new site. After so many tees dotted (with coffee stains) and eyes crossed from long nights at the terminal, it's hard to describe the feeling when **It Just Works**â„¢. In the present case, almost every step of the development and deployment process just works in such a Teflon-coated Slip 'n' Slide sorta way that I'm elated to pop the hood for you.
