Delightfully often, when I've combed the web for help designing, developing, and publishing sites, apps, I land on someone's "How I Made This" post on their custom blog. That, or on StackOverflow, or on a Github issue, or increasingly these days on [DEV](dev.to). So this one goes out to all those paid it forward and lent me a hand.

It still feels like nothing short of a miracle to publish a new site. After so many tees dotted (with coffee stains) and eyes crossed from long nights at the terminal, it's hard to describe the feeling when **It Just Works**â„¢. In the present case, almost every step of the development and deployment process just works in such a Teflon-coated Slip 'n' Slide sorta way that I'm elated to pop the hood for you.

## TL;DR

### The Stack a.k.a. [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/atmanaut.us)
- Hugo, generating a lightning-fast, theme-able static site with Go power
- [`now`](zeit.com/now), for no-frills, full-auto deployment/hosting/DNS from the terminal
- vim + tmux + oh-my-zsh, for memorizing shitloads of keybindings and then magic
- IA Writer - for hipster purity XP, LVL 99, and 'cos vim is a harsh mistress
