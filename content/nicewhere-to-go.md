From the desk of the Secretary of Ain'tseenityet comes a pants-warming, boots-mudding memo:

## **How to Where to Vacay**

I see an excess supply of vacation out there. There are WAY more places to go and things to see than we, who must vacate our daily lives periodically to maintain our insanity, could check off. Even when I was one-bag traveling full-time, more travel opportunities present themselves than can even be catalogued for future adventures, much less worked into an itinerary.

Two things they teach you in Econ 101. It's okay to sleep through the lecture, you're not the dumbest ass in college. And two when there is an excess supply, price drops or stuff goes to waste. So why isn't vacation extremely cheap?

First off, anyone in the vacation business doesn't want it to be cheap. Vacation implies space. Discounting the value of a vacation experience would induce more vacationers, who take up space, to cankle in. For those providing hospitality, there is a middle path between too few and too many patrons where things are lively, but not messy or overwhelming; somewhere between a ghost town and a Vegas buffet. Somewhere over the rainbow lies an ideal flowstate for the vacation system where everyone involved is maxin' and/or relaxin'.

Secondly, it is extremely cheap, depending on what you call vacation. If you only listen to the roar of the advertofascisyndicapitalist media monster, you're aware of deals on flights, hotels, cruises to third-world islands, public restrooms/waterparks, and tourist traps and roadside attractions within a day-trip radius. If those don't strike your fancy, there are gads of special interests, hobbies, and thrills to seek. Check the magazine rack at the airport for 10 ways to free-two-day-shipping yourself new gear you'll use twice. Just wait until Saturday! You can get a late start and end up in traffic trying to escape the city with the rest of us. And when you arrive at the trailhead you saw on Buzzfeed, there's nowhere to park, because, well it was on Buzzfeed.

Hold on, hold on. Do I really need 25 reasons and a $1500 SLR to enjoy a walk in the hills? Let's look at a different scenario.

The weather is perfect, Marklar levels just right. I didn't get lost on the way here, and it was easy to park (in fact we shared a ride so I didn't have to park). I found out yesterday that the Rainbow Hoosefarthings are in bloom this week and they're only 5 miles from my house. How come I never knew about this? It's so beautiful! Wish I'd had a $1500 SLR to capture this! Just kidding, I'm in the here and now, where I always am but sometimes pretend not to be. Ooh, are those dragonflies fighting...? No, nope. Not fighting.

Vacation should be simple, cheap, and frequent. How do we fix this? Is there an app for that?

## Lt. Commander Data to the Bridge

We need more data. Where and when is it nice to be? Who keeps track of this stuff?

Weather databases could provide some insight about past conditions in current locations. If only photos contained some weather info in their metadata. With enough photos with timestamps and geodata, we may be able to roughly induce the quality of the environs. An AI could be trained for this task. Classify photos with faces by emotional affect on a positive-negative axis then plot a four-dimensional heat map of our fair planet where the heat is how nice it is to be there. Take that fourth dimension and make it a scrubber, the other three can be spatial. Spin the globe and scrub the seasons to find your next vacation spot.

But first, we need more data.

We could poll the audience. With a few ~~tidal~~ viral waves of tagging on Instagram we could start logging where and when it is nice worldwide.
