      <description>Hard questions From Kant: What can I know? What should I do? What may I hope?
 Who are we? How did we get here? Why are we here? Who wants to know? Is this a game? How do we win? Can we win? What is there to fear? Who wants pizza? Is there anybody out there? Does the Earth know we&amp;rsquo;re here? Does she have feelings? Do electrons make choices?</description>
